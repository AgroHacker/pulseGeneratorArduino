# pulseGeneratorArduino
AD9954 based pulse generator -  Arduino Shield 


This project is currently in the early development process.  

A little background information.  This is my first major programming/maker/github project.  I am developing an open source soil moisture probe.  The pulse generator is just one component of this system.   More detail of the overall project will be added shortly.  

 Currently the eagle files will not correctly export gcode files with pcb gcode. Not sure why but the crash error reported by DrMingw is saved as ERROR-Dr.Mingw.txt
